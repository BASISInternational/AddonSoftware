			<ul>
                <li>New for version 23.00</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounting</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New "Print Check" button in Manual Check Entry allows printing manual checks on-demand.</li>
                        <li>Scanned AP Invoice images can now be attached to any invoice, regardless of whether or not Payment Authorization is used, and new parameters can be set to warn on registers and/or disallow updates if an image has not been linked to an invoice.</li>
                        <li>Loading/viewing scanned AP Invoice images now display inside a BBjHtmlView control rather than an external browser.</li>
                        <li>Added a Vendor Pay-To Address additional option to the Vendor master form for when checks to the vendor are sent to an address different than the vendor's main address.</li>
                        <li>The Vendor Master has a new Payment History Inquiry option for viewing all checks and related invoices for the vendor.</li>
                        <li>The Bank Account Code table contains two new fields: one to control whether or not to include a MICR band at the bottom of AP Checks and On-demand Manual Checks, and the other to specify how to format the bank account number. The bank account number format has a drilldown to view valid MICR characters.</li>
                        <li>New filters and drill downs in the Vendor form's Historical Invoices query provide a link to the new Payment History Inquiry, so users can drill from invoices to payments/adjustments, then to check detail.</li>
                        <li>A new Payment History option on the Customer form shows payments, with a drill down from any given payment to the payment details/invoices paid. Drill on a given invoice to launch the AR Invoice History Inquiry form. The Payment History has also been added to the Customers node in Expresso Search.</li>
                        <li>A new right-click context menu option on the Historical Invoices query shows all the GL transactions associated with the selected Invoice.</li>
                        <li>A new AR Invoices query shows all, open, or paid invoices for a customer, and a right-click context menu option shows all the GL transactions associated with the selected Invoice.</li>
                        <li>The AR Simple Invoice update writes the entry header/detail records to a new set of archival files before removing them from the entry files. A new Archived AR Invoices form allows users to view and print the archival invoices.</li>
                        <li>The AP Invoice Number has been expanded from 10 to 20 characters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Distribution</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Picking Lists, Order Acknowledgements and Invoices now show Cash customer manual ship-to addresses in both the Bill-To and Ship-To address boxes.</li>
                        <li>Order Entry can be filtered to present only Quotes, or only Orders, or both.</li>
                        <li>A new lookup in Order and Invoice Entry shows historical manual ship-to addresses, and a new option allows creating a Customer ship-to address from the manual ship-to address.</li>
                        <li>The Customer Ship-To Addresses form has a new "Use Manual Ship-To" option that lets the user create a new ship-to address from a manual ship-to address previously used for the customer.</li>
                        <li>Barcodes for the customer, order, and detail line items can now be included on the Sales Order Picking List.</li>
                        <li>When printing for all warehouses, Picking List items are sorted by warehouse.</li>
                        <li>The new Order Fulfillment task lets users enter picking, packing and shipping information for an order, and print a legitimate Packing List rather than using the Pick List. After an order fulfillment is completed, the information can either be pulled into Invoice Entry, or pushed into Invoice Entry using the Fulfillment Report.</li>
                        <li>Increased the maximum allowed size of an AP Invoice number from 10 to 20 characters.</li>
                    </ul>
