			Version 21.10 takes advantage of the technological advancements provided by Barista&reg; and BBj&reg; to deliver an innovative software package known for its structural quality. Together with Barista, AddonSoftware offers a leap forward in the efficiency of software customization and the creation of vertical applications. AddonSoftware
continues its history of constant improvement - additional features, increased functionality, and updated technology - in this release.
			<ul>
            <li>Preview features for version 22.00</li>
            <ul>
                <li> </li>

            <li>New for version 21.00</li>
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>General</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Addon installs and upgrades are now version controlled using Git. Features of this new Git-based model include:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Installs and upgrades automatically create the recommended version-neutral file structure.</li>
                            <li>Facilitates making Addon customizations directly in the Addon file structure, eliminating the need for a separate "mods project."</li>
                            <li>The Upgrade Wizard uses Barista's "Saved Selection Options" feature to save and quickly restore grid entries when resuming/restarting.</li>
                            <li>The new Packager/Extractor utility simplifies moving a Barista/Addon instance between production and test servers.</li>
                            <li>Automatically incorporates customizations from mods projects directly into Addon.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Modified the AR Aging Report to require 30-day fixed periods, and always aging credits and future invoices when the "Update Customer Aging Summary" option is selected.</li>
                        <li>A new option is available in the Customers, Credit Maintenance, and Order/Invoice Entry forms that allows users to refresh the customer's aged balances on demand. The option is enabled or disabled via a new "On-demand Aging?" parameter.</li>
                        <li>The new Default Age By parameter supplies the default aging basis (I=Invoice Date, D=Due Date) for the Aging Report, Age Transactions, and Statements tasks as well as for back-end aging updates when no aging basis has yet been established for a given customer.</li>
                        <li>The Customer form's Aging/Sales Summary tab has a new drill down on the Last Payment Date to quickly see how the payment was applied.</li>
